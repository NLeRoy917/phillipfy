# phillipfy
Python application that will change the color of your phillips hue lights dependent on the album art color for the current song you are listening to on Spotify. Currently under development.


# Installation
TODO - for now, installation will require creating an app with Spotify develoeprs, modifying the Colorgram.py module, and setting some environment variables.
